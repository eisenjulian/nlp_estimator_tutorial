Index $1$ represents the beginning of the sentence and the index $2$ is assigned to all unknown (also known as *out-of-vocabulary* or *OOV*) tokens. These indexes have been obtained by pre-processing the text data in a pipeline that cleans, normalizes and tokenizes each sentence first and then builds a dictionary indexing each of the tokens by frequency. We are not convering these techniques in this post, but you can take a look at [this chapter](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch03.html) of the NLTK book to learn more.\n",

        "\n",
        "The next step of complexity we can add are word embeddings. Embeddings are a dense low-dimensional representation of sparse high-dimensional data. This allows our model to learn a more meaningful representation of each token, rather than just an index. While an individual dimension is not meaningful, the low-dimensional space---when learned from a large enough corpus---has been shown to capture relations such as tense, plural, gender, thematic relatedness, and many more. We can add word embeddings by converting our existing feature column into an `embedding_column`. The representation seen by the model is the mean of the embeddings for each token (see the `combiner` argument in the [docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/embedding_column)). We can plug in the embedded features into a pre-canned `DNNClassifier`. \n",
        "\n",
        "A note for the keen observer: an `embedding_column` is just an efficient way of applying a fully connected layer to the sparse binary feature vector of tokens, which is multiplied by a constant depending on the chosen combiner. A direct consequence of this is that it wouldn't make sense to use an `embedding_column` directly in a `LinearClassifier` because two consecutive linear layers without non-linearities in between add no prediction power to the model, unless of course the embeddings are pre-trained."

One the many benefits it provides is that the same code will be able to run in CPUs, GPUs and even in a distributed setup. There's a small family of pre-made estimators, like the ones we used earlier, but it's most likely that you will need to build your own.

        "\n",
        "Using the `Estimator` API and the same model `head`, we can also create a classifier that uses a *Long Short-Term Memory* (*LSTM*) cell instead of convolutions. Recurrent models such as this are some of the most successful building blocks for NLP applications. An LSTM processes the entire document sequentially, recursing over the sequence with its cell while storing the current state of the sequence in its memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the drawbacks of recurrent models compared to CNNs is that, because of the nature of recursion, models are deeper and more complex, which usually results in slower training time and worse convergence. LSTMs (and RNNs in general) can suffer convergence issues like vanishing or exploding gradients. Having said that, with sufficient tuning they obtain state-of-the-art results for many problems. As a rule of thumb, CNNs are good at feature extraction, while RNNs excel at tasks that depend on the meaning of the whole sentence, like question answering or machine translation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each cell processes one token embedding at a time updating its internal state based on a differentiable computation that depends on both the embedding vector $x_t$ and the previous state $h_{t-1}$. In order to get a better understanding of how LSTMs work, you can refer to Chris Olah’s [blog post](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).\n",

        "In the beginning of this notebook, we padded all documents up to $200$ tokens, which is necessary to build a proper tensor. However, when a document contains fewer than $200$ words, we don't want the LSTM to continue processing padding tokens as it does not add information and degrades performance. For this reason, we additionally want to provide our network with the length of the original sequence before it was padded. Internally, the model then copies the last state through to the sequence's end. We can do this by using the `\"len\"` feature in our input functions. We can now use the same logic as above and simply replace the convolutional, pooling, and flatten layers with our LSTM cell."
